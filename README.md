## Synopsis

Simple registration site written in Angular and Slim for the University of Toronto's Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Dinner Dance.

## Motivation

Because people can't organize table arrangement on their own!

## Installation

This website uses a couple of dependencies using composer. Please use composer to grab the appropriate ones. The repository also comes with a SQL set up file to get started. In order to complete setup, users must copy config_sample.php and rename it with config.php with your appropriate credentials.
